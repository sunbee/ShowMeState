*rev000*: Display keypad.
*rev001*: Include calibration feature and enable keypad.
*rev002*: Package the code that enables keypad into a function.
*rev003*: Create class Keypad with methods for drawing/calibration/sensing keypad.
*rev004*: Add a new class for analog clock.
*rev005*: Add a class Timer for controlling outlets and operate power outlets.
*rev006*: Combine analong clock and keypad in display main.
*rev007*: Add feature to obtain local time from the internet.

Ref: [gist](https://gist.github.com/sunbee/68fbf68458fda3a0b3dc803c2ee610a9) with an explanation of functions for drawing, calibration and sensing keypad. 

STEPS:
1. Display keypad. BUT it doesn't sense touch!
2. Add touch-sense feature and calibration routine. BUT main is ~300 lines and hard to extend.
3. Refactor to OOP. Create class Keypad with design attributes (fonts, shapes, layout) and methods to render graphics, sense touch and execute callbacks. BUT we need clock too, for timed events.
4. Create class for analog clock, sync'ing to internet time. BUT no action (yet!)
5. Create class Timer for burning-down time interval to scheduled events and executing callbacks. 
6. Rewrite classes for analog clock and keypad for cohesive display and enable override.
7. Clean up!

Short-Shorts
1. Clock .. Render the following (1.) Face - Draw/Erase trick (2.) Ticks - Coordinate Transform (3.) Hands - Draw/Erase
2. Millis and non-blocking
3. Object Oriented Code - Class examples keypad, analog clock
4. Timer - burning down (1.) Gantt chart w cursor (2.)
